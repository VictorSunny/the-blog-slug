## Installation

- Open a terminal and clone this repo to your desired folder

- Create your .env file and set the necessary environment variables

- Inside the project folder, run "python manage.py makemigrations" followed by "python manage.py migrate" to initialize your database

- Lastly, run...

```bash
  python manage.py runserver
```

## Tests


Before carrying out tests, set DEBUG to True in your .env file, open the trendcatcher.py file inside the core app and unhash the "if" code block from line 22 to line 25.

This will eliminate the need for an api key to use the worldnewsapi, and you will be served a static json file containing news articles to be displayed on the homepage.

To use worldnewsapi to get realtime news, signup, and add your api key (WORLD_NEWS_API_KEY) variable to your .env and connect to the internet.
