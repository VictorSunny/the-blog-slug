African conservationists are trying to change that", "text": "Vultures have an image crisis. Seen as ugly and associated with death, they are among the least loved animals in the world. But conservationists in Africa are trying to change that.\nThey have launched an effort to save endangered vultures by trying to put a dollar figure on their incredible value.\nA recent report by the BirdLife International conservation organisation has estimated that vultures are worth US$1.8 billion a year to certain ecosystems in southern Africa, which might surprise anyone not familiar with the clean-up, pest control and anti-poaching work performed by one of the most efficient scavengers on the planet.\n“They are not up there on the pretty scale. And they are not popular. But we know they are very useful,” said Fadzai Matsvimbo, an extinction prevention coordinator at BirdLife International.\n\nThe report comes at an important time for Africa’s vultures; six of the 11 species found on the continent are listed as endangered or critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which says vultures are highly threatened in many parts of the world. In Africa, some species have declined by nearly 90 per cent, according to Matsvimbo.\nConservationists hope the report will make authorities and the public more aware of the positive impact of vultures.\nIt focused on research in Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe and shows how a wake of vultures – the term for a group of feeding vultures – can strip a decomposing carcass in hours, cleaning up ecosystems, reducing the chance of disease spreading and the presence of pests such as rats and feral dogs, which has great benefits to communities.\nVultures also have extremely strong stomach acid, do not get food poisoning and are able to consume and neutralise anthrax, botulism and other bacteria and toxins in carcasses that would kill other animals, removing deadly threats from the environment. Just this week, more than 50 hippos died from suspected anthrax poisoning in a reserve in Congo.\nVultures are nature’s “best sanitation services”, according to Matsvimbo. Conservationists have raised the case of the drastic loss of vultures in India over the last 30 years and how that led to a health crisis. A study published last year said half a million people died in India because of the spread of bacteria and infections in the absence of vultures.\nMatsvimbo said vultures in Africa were also used as “sentinels” by game rangers because they were often the first to spot a dead animal and could lead rangers to where poachers might be active. They have even proved useful in helping farmers locate dead or injured livestock.\n\nVultures are unique among land vertebrates in that they only feed on carrion – dead animals. That makes them especially susceptible to poisoning by humans, either intentionally by poachers and others who want to get rid of them, or by mistake when pests are the target. Hundreds of vultures can die from a single poisoned carcass.\nVultures are also regularly killed or maimed in collisions with power lines in Africa. And they are increasingly being killed for belief-based reasons, according to Kerri Wolter, the CEO of the Vulpro vulture rehabilitation centre in South Africa, which treats sick and injured vultures to be released back into the wild.\nAs vultures have such outstanding eyesight and instincts when it comes to finding a dead animal, they are viewed by some as being clairvoyant and able to foresee death, Wolter has said. Their body parts, and especially their head, are used in potions or as charms to predict the future.\n“Our work is to change the mindsets of people,” Wolter said. “For them to see vultures and think, wow that is amazing.”\nMatsvimbo and Wolter both said vultures had been given a raw deal by filmmakers in Hollywood, where they were almost always shown as evil and sinister. Films had done for vultures what Jaws did for sharks, Wolter said.\n“I love watching The Lion King, but every time they do the vulture part, my heart breaks,” Matsvimbo said. “Vultures are never portrayed in a positive way. I have a bone to chew with these moviemakers. Or should that be bone to pick?”", "summary": "Vultures are nature’s ‘best sanitation services’, and are estimated to worth US$1.8 billion a year to certain ecosystems in southern Africa.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/world/africa/article/3306277/vultures-are-among-least-loved-animals-african-conservationists-are-trying-change", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/12/1bf5af36-4abc-4bbf-b6d0-835bfbb12b42_cd45a15d.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-12 06:40:26", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": -0.098}, {"id": 310353094, "title": "Brazil’s Bolsonaro hospitalised with abdominal pain, in ‘stable’ condition", "text": "Brazil’s far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro was airlifted to a hospital after suffering a painful bowel obstruction on Friday that forced him to abandon a political tour – his latest health complication six years after being stabbed in the stomach.\nThe 70-year-old, who is seeking to make a political comeback even as he faces a criminal trial, started feeling “unbearable abdominal pain” at a political event on Friday in the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte, a senior member of his Liberal Party said.\nHe was brought to a hospital where he was “stabilised”, according to right-wing senator Rogerio Marinho, then flown by helicopter to a bigger facility in the state capital, Natal.\nBolsonaro “remains under observation and will spend the night in hospital”, Luiz Roberto Fonseca, medical director of the Rio Grande hospital, told a news conference late on Friday.\n\nSurgeon Helio Barreto added that “for the moment, no surgery is planned”, adding that the ex-president had seen “improvement” with “decreased pain”.\nTelevision footage had earlier shown Bolsonaro walking to the helicopter, with evident discomfort.\nBolsonaro has had recurring health problems since September 2018, when an attacker stabbed the then candidate at a presidential campaign rally in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais.\nHe lost some 40 per cent of his blood and underwent emergency surgery after the attack perpetrated by a man later declared mentally unfit to stand trial.\nHe went on to win that election, serving a single term until 2022 when he lost a run-off to leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\n“Thank God, my condition is stable and I am recovering, without fever.

It is the first new aircraft type to be introduced by an Indian airline in over a decade. As of now, the revamped experience is available on key international routes like London, New York, San Francisco, Frankfurt, and Singapore.\n\nThe Airbus A350-900 aircrafts introduce new experiences, such as onboard Wi-Fi, improved screens with over 3000 hours of entertainment content, and more. Air India is changing for the better. I recently flew from Delhi to London on AI111, and here are five upgraded tech features you should be aware of before your next long-haul flight from India.\n\nRevamped Infotainment System\n\nEconomy cabin class infotainment system\nPrakhar Khanna\n\nThe A350-900 offers an upgraded infotainment experience, thanks to bigger and sharper screens (that actually work). You get a 21-inch display in Business Class, a 13.5-inch screen in Premium Economy, and a 12-inch display in Economy. All offer 1080p Full HD resolution for their catalog of over 3000 hours of entertainment content across formats and genres. This includes 1400 hours of movies, 850 hours of TV, and 1000 hours of audio.\n\nForbesiPhone 16e Vs iPhone 16: What Do You Get For $200 More?By Prakhar Khanna\n\nWhile the Hollywood collection includes close to 300 movies, BAFTA and Oscar-winning titles, the Indian content ranges from Bollywood to regional cinema with 120 movies in regional languages and a total of over 300 Indian movies spanning decades. The TV collection includes content from HBO, Sony Liv, Hulu, HBO+, and more. Plus, you get access to an extensive library of content from Vogue, GQ, and The New Yorker. For kids, there’s an extensive selection of over 100 hours of curated audio and video content across three sections: Pre-School, Kids, and Teens.\n\nIn my experience, the infotainment system was responsive and provided good colors for an in-flight system. It was more intuitive than before, thanks to the upgraded headsets with noise cancellation, available for Premium Economy and Business Class. I willingly watched movies on this instead of opting to take out my iPad.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nMicrosoft’s Free Upgrade Offer For 500 Million Windows Users\n\nToday’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Saturday, April 12th\n\n‘A Minecraft Movie’ On Pace For $80 Million Box Office In Weekend 2\n\nOnboard Wi-Fi\n\nAir India onboard Wi-Fi\n\nThis was one of the biggest factors missing from Air India flights. Early last year, I flew from San Francisco to Delhi on a long-haul flight with no internet, which resulted in a day’s worth of office hours wasted. It’s a different story if you’re flying over weekends, but most people don’t have the luxury of taking workdays off for a flight. Thankfully, it’s changing with the new A350-900 lineup.\n\nOn my way to and from London, I could connect to the Wi-Fi to stay connected on Slack and file stories in the CMS (Content Management System). It’s as fast as in-flight Wi-Fi can be. Apart from the A350, Air India’s internet connectivity service is now available on domestic and international flights operated by Boeing 787-9 and select Airbus A321neo aircraft.\n\nIntegrated Apple AirTag Support\n\nIntegrated AirTag support\n\nAir India is claimed to be the first airline in Asia to integrate the Apple AirTag service for its passengers. While you can always add an AirTag to your bag and track it with your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, an integrated service is different because it builds upon the baggage tracking feature offered within the airline through its app and website.\nForbesApple Intelligence Expands To More Regions: 11 Features You Should TryBy Prakhar Khanna\n\nYou need to file a Property Irregularity Report (PIR) for the baggage at Air India’s Baggage Counter at the airport and then generate the ‘Share Item Location’ in the ‘Find My’ app on your Apple device. Share the location link with Air India by pasting the AirTag link within Lost and Found Check-in Baggage > Share Item Location. This feature rolled out recently, after my trip, so I wasn’t able to test it. That said, it’s a great-to-have feature for unfortunate times when a bag is misplaced due to logistical issues.\n\nUpgraded Cabin Humidifier\n\nAI111 Business cabin class\nPrakhar Khanna\n\nThe A350-900 offers an upgraded cabin humidifier in Business Class for a cozier experience. It’s especially essential for Southeast Asia and the Middle East-bound flights, as it helps tackle the dryness and humidity in those areas efficiently.\n\nThe Air India Business Class cabin features a humidifier that boosts humidity to over 20% (from the usual 5%). As a result, you get a better, hydrated environment that helps reduce fatigue, jet lag, and dehydrated skin.\n\nIt’s 2025. Of Course, There’s AI\n\nAir India AEYE Vision\nPrakhar Khanna\n\nAir India is using artificial intelligence in its mobile app for a feature called AEYE Vision. The company says that it’s built in-house and offers “AI-based computer vision technology” to provide functionalities like boarding pass scanning, accessing flight details, baggage status, and more.\nForbesOppo Find X8 Ultra Trims Camera Bump And Yet Retains Four 50MP CamerasBy Prakhar Khanna\n\nTo scan your boarding pass, open the Air India mobile app, go to the My Trips section, and tap on Add Trip > Open AEYE Vision. It will fill in the flight information automatically, and you can then check your flight and baggage status conveniently. Similarly, you can scan your baggage tag, and the app will inform you when the bags are loaded, unloaded, and ready for pickup at baggage claim.\n\nAI111 Business cabin class seat\nPrakhar Khanna\n\nThe Business Class cabin is also upgraded to offer a more spacious experience, a step up from the 2-4-2 layout. You now get your own private space, with delicious in-flight dining options and a comfortable foldable mattress for when you want to catch up on sleep. All of these revamped features put Air India on the global map with a much-improved and better experience than before.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades", "summary": "From upgraded cabin interiors to advanced inflight entertainment, here are five key tech features on the Air India A350-900 that modernize its international flying experience.", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/prakharkhanna/2025/04/12/air-indias-a350-in-action-5-tech-upgrades-that-improve-long-haul-flying/", "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67f9f2f82216609b13705e5a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds", "video": null, "publish_date": "2025-04-12 06:05:56", "author": "Contributor,Prakhar Khanna", "authors": ["Contributor", "Prakhar Khanna"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.249}, {"id": 310352846, "title": "One UI 7 Update Schedule: Is Your Samsung Galaxy Phone On The List?", "text": "Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 camera module\nPrakhar Khanna\n\nSamsung released its latest One UI 7, based on Android 15, with the Galaxy S25 series launch in January.
